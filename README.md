## BitTorrent Client

Collaborative project. I developed the project design, and I wrote the peer protocol (peermanager.py, peer.py) section and worked on bittorrent.py.

Type 'print' while running to view information on peers and download progress.

## Requirements

```
bitarray
numpy
bencode.py
pytimerfd
urllib3
```
